# wanco üê∂

![plot](docs/assets/animal_dance_dog.png)

wanco is a WebAssembly AOT compiler which supports cross-platform (CPU and OS) Checkpoint/Restore functionalities. wanco is forked from [Wasker](https://github.com/mewz-project/wasker).


See [examples](./examples) for quick start.

## Build

Prerequisites:

- POSIX compliant OS (Linux, TODO: support macOS)
- Cargo (Rust)
    - Install from the [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

To install dependencies in Linux/Debian, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install LLVM 17 and LibPolly
wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
chmod +x llvm.sh
sudo ./llvm.sh 17
sudo apt install libpolly-17-dev

# Install all other deps
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libunwind-dev libelf-dev libzstd-dev
```

First, clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:tamaroning/wanco.git
$ cd wanco
```

This project includes C++ projects and Rust projects.
To build the entire project, run the following commands.

```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

To install the compilers and runtime libraries, run the following commands:

```sh
$ sudo make install
```

## Run

After building the project, you will find the `wanco` binary in the top of `build` directory.

Before compiling wasm modules, make sure to add clang to the PATH environment variable or to specify the path to clang or clang++ by using the `--clang-path` option. (clang/clang++ version 17 or later is required.)

If `--clang-path` is not set, `clang-17` is used by default.

To compile the hello-world example, run:

```sh
$ wanco examples/hello.wat -o hello
$ ./hello
Hello World!
```

To show the help, run:

```sh
$ wanco --help
```

For debugging, run the compiler with `RUST_LOG="debug" wanco <ARGS>`.

### Enable Checkpoint/Restore functionalities

Compile a WebAssembly file with C/R enabled and run it:

```sh
$ wanco --enable-cr demo/fib.wat
$ a.out
```

While the process is running, you can trigger checkpoint by sending `SIGUSR1` signal from another teminal:

(The running process is automatically terminated and the snapshot file is created.)

```sh
$ pkill -10 a.out
```

To restore the execution, run:

```sh
$ ./a.out --restore checkpoint.json
```

Note: Snapshot files are named `checkpoint.json` or `checkpoint.pb` (binary format generated with protobuf).

### Compile and assemble only

If you do not want a generated object file to be linked with runtime libraries, specify the `-c` option when running the compiler:
LLVM assembly file (`.ll`) will be generated.

```sh
$ wanco examples/hello.wat -c -o hello.ll
```

After that, you can link it with the runtime library together by using clang

```
$ clang -flto -no-pie hello.ll /usr/local/lib/libwanco_rt.a /usr/local/lib/libwanco_wasi.a -o hello
```

## Test

To test the compiler, run:

```sh
$ cargo test
```

## Devcontainer

```
docker buildx build .

```
